# Flappy Pixelbox
Just a Flappy game made with [Pixelbox](https://github.com/cstoquer/pixelbox).

This game is just a demo, and I hope it can be usefull to people new to Pixelbox and new to programming games in general.

For the simplest version of the game (simple code, easier for beginners) go to the [simple-version](https://github.com/BarbaAlGhul/flappy-pixelbox/tree/simple-version) branch.
