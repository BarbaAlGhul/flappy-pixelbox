# Flappy Pixelbox
Just a Flappy game made with [Pixelbox](https://github.com/cstoquer/pixelbox).

This game is just a demo, and I hope it can be usefull to people new to Pixelbox and new to programming games in general.

This branch is the first version of the game, very simple and basic, and the aim is to provide a quick start in the Pixelbox framework. If you are new to programming, start from here. If you know your way around a little bit, check the [main branch](https://github.com/BarbaAlGhul/flappy-pixelbox/tree/main).
